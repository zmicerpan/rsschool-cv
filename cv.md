## About me:
I'm a 35 years old system administrator who is eager to continue my career in Front-end development. Having the background on how the systems work from the hardware perspective I am now keen on learning how it works from the user’s perspective. I have started from the basics courses in BelHard academy to get the preliminary knowledge of what it is. And now I’m here to improve the knowledge and dig deeper.
